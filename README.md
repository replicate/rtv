# RTV

## How to add prompts

Stick 'em in `prompts.json`.

## How to run it

You need to set `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` and `RTMP_URL` (with Mux: `<rtmp_url>/<token>`) in your environment then run `foreman`.

## How it works

Two bits:

### Writer

Writer generates tiles on Replicate. They are saved as a queue in the directory `queue` as ordered JSON files.

It will generate tiles in parallel at whatever rate is needed to keep a 5 minute buffer.

### Broadcaster

Broadcaster takes tiles in the `queue` directory and broadcasts them in order to Mux using ffmpeg. When a tile has been successfully broadcast, it gets deleted from the queue.

## Deploy

```
fly deploy
```

## Debugging

If things get stuck, you can SSH into the Fly instance and look at the queue:

```
$ fly ssh console                                                                                                                                                            !10251
